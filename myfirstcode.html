                <a href="Profile.html"><u><h3><link>Home    </h3></u> </a>Since time immemorial, animals have been an integral part of our food. They have been used to obtain food like milk, eggs, meat, etc. Other than the food, we use them even for some basic requirements like wool, silk, labour, etc. The population has reached its peak, especially in a country like India. The population explosion has led to greater demand for basic requirements such as food, shelter, clothing, etc. To meet the increasing requirements and demands we need to apply a greater effort. One such effort to meet the food demand is animal husbandry. Animal husbandry includes cattle farming, poultry farming, fisheries, apiculture, etc. Here we will learn about cattle farming.
                Cattle farming involves the rearing and management of two types of animals- one group for food requirements like milk and another for labour purposes like ploughing, irrigation, etc.   Animals which provide milk are called milch/dairy animals. For example, goats, buffalo, cows, etc. Animals which are used for labour are called draught animals.

Since dairy animals are cared for and bred for milk, we need to improve milk production to meet the requirements. The period after the birth of a calf, when a cow starts to produce milk, is called the lactation period. We can enhance milk production by increasing this lactation period. But along with milk production, quality must also meet. Dairy farm management is the management of the milch animals with the goal of enhancing the quantity and quality of the milk produced. For this reason, high-yielding and disease-resistant breeds are developed.

Farm Management
Cattle farming is not all about milk or meat production. It also comes with some responsibilities. To meet human requirements, we need to take good care and need proper management of livestock.
